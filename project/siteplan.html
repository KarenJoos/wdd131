            Vision Board
            In the past I have not been one that dreamed of the future. I am coming to the realization I want things to change in my
            life and for the better. In order, for this to occur I need dreams to help me know how to prioritize the things that
            would help my dreams become a reality.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Site Purpose
            I am going to provide my dreams in a few different areas. I will do one for my hobbies, life, and spiritual things.
        </p>
        <p>   
            Scenarios
            What are some hobbies that may be interesting?
            What are some life goals that one may have?
            What spiritual things would someone have?
        </p>
        <p>    
            Color Schema
            #7E78D2 Tropical Indigo, #000 Black, #BDEDE0 Celeste if I decide to use as well.
            I would use the black for the font color, I would use the Tropical Indigo for the heading and footer. If I want color
            behind the others I will add the Celeste.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Topography
            Roboto is the font that I choose. It is easy to read. I will use this one throughout. If I need to add a different one
            then I will use one for the body and one for the headings throughout.
